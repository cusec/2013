<div id="fry" class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="wp-content/themes/cusec/speakers/fry.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Ben Fry</h4>
<p>Ben Fry spends most of his time thinking about, and making pictures of, patterns and structures found in complex and dynamic sources of data. Drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science, he pursues this fascination as principal of Fathom Information Design in Boston, Massachusetts, where he produces software, printed works, installations, and books that explain and depict topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents.</p>
<p>He’s also a co-founder of the Processing project, which seeks to ruin the careers of talented designers by tempting them away from their usual tools and into the world of programming and computation. Similarly, the project is designed to turn engineers and computer scientists to less gainful employment as artists and designers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
Earn hundreds of dollars a day while working from the comfort of your own home!  I&#8217;ll discuss three very different career paths in computerland (working at a large company, a funded startup, and building your own project) and what&#8217;s wonderful and not so wonderful about each one.  I&#8217;ll also talk about the nuts and bolts of running Pinboard, a one-person project with nearly thirty thousand paying users, and what I see as opportunities for smart young tech people who value their independence to make an interesting living on their own terms.</p>

<div id="gate" class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="wp-content/themes/cusec/speakers/gate.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Richard Gate</h4>
<p>Richard Gate is the founder of a small IT wizardry company called CommuniG8, the Technical Director of CommunityUK.net who specialise in building community based Wireless Networks and co-owner of a physical training Gym (which confuses him, as he’s really not built for that). And a regular attendee at CUSEC over the past 3 years.</p>
<p>Richard used to have a very sleepless existence worrying about the Mainframe Data Centre Systems he ran and supported. So he moved in to the world of Wintel, running and supporting Windows based Servers for a number of large customers but still the lack of sleep took it’s toll. Finally, he had enough of being told how things should be done and started to look at how things could be done. This led to the insanity of leaving a steady job to build Open Source based solutions. Now sleep is possible, having integrated a number of Open Source projects into the business of running Wireless networks.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
In the spirit of this year&#8217;s conference theme &#8220;System.Out&#8221;, I thought it may be of interest to see how the output from Software Engineering is being used. I will show how the integration of a number of Open Source Projects and Services has provided the infrastructure for the wide area Wireless Network run by CommunityUK.net. And how this lets me sleep better at night or any time.</p>
</div>
<div id="edouard" class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="wp-content/themes/cusec/speakers/edouard.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Nick Edouard</h4>

<p>Prior to BuzzData, Nick established and ran the North American operations of Nomad Digital, a UK-based telecom company, delivering on-train Wi-Fi solutions for Amtrak, VIA Rail and others. He has previously co-founded the UK’s leading site management company for emerging wireless technologies and spent 5 years as a strategy consultant principally with Arthur D. Little. He thinks that his technology geekery is balanced by having an MA in Classics and Philosophy from Trinity College, Oxford, but deep down he knows better.</p>
<p>BuzzData is an information publishing and engagement platform for the enterprise market (B2B &amp; B2C):</p>
<ol>
<li>BuzzData lets people easily make and share LookBooks – smart, visual arrangements of facts, figures and files that inform and convince</li>
<li>We give people the tools they need to help them make new interactive artefacts for use in their LookBooks (e.g. infographics, dynamic charts)</li>
<li>We give people an engagement environment (a Hive) in which they can make and share their LookBooks with their intended audience</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BuzzData is launching its new product &#8211; LookBooks &#8211; in early 2013. Nick will give a sneak peek at what BuzzData&#8217;s been hard at work on throughout 2012 and explain, most importantly, why LookBooks are significant for the developer community and anyone interested in data and information sharing.</p>

<h3>Academic</h3>
<div id="cisek" class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="wp-content/themes/cusec/speakers/cisek.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Dr. Paul Cisek</h4>
<p>Paul Cisek is an associate professor at the department of physiology at the University of Montréal. After obtaining a B.Sc. in computer science from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1991 and working briefly at Microsoft, he became interested in pursuing an academic career in the brain sciences. He enrolled at the computational neuroscience program at Boston University, where he worked with Drs. Stephen Grossberg and Daniel Bullock, two pioneers in the field of neural networks. After obtaining his Ph.D. in 1997, he sought to complement his theoretical experience with experimental work in cortical neurophysiology.</p>
<p>In his postdoctoral studies he worked with Dr. Steve Scott at Queen’s University, studying the neural mechanisms of motor control, and later with Dr. John Kalaska at the University of Montréal, studying the cortical mechanisms of planning and decision-making. In 2004 he joined the faculty of the University of Montréal where he has established a lab studying decision-making and movement planning using computational modeling, psychophysics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and multi-electrode recording in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
Moving beyond the computer metaphor for the brain</p>
<p>A central concept in modern efforts to understand human intelligence is the idea that brains are information processing systems, which use sensory input to build perceptual representations and knowledge of the world, store and retrieve memories, make decisions, and plan and execute actions. However, the results of many neurophysiological studies are not compatible with this classic and influential view. Instead, I will argue that the brain should be seen within its evolutionary context &#8211; as a control system for interacting with the world &#8211; and will discuss the implications of this notion for understanding brains and simulating them in machines.</p>
</div>
<div id="bergler" class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="wp-content/themes/cusec/speakers/bergler.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Dr. Sabine Bergler</h4>

She is part of the recent IMMERSE network for game immersion and SpokenWeb 2.0: developing digital archives for spoken word resources.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
Back to the Future?</p>
<p>There is a lifecycle to knowledge: how we generate it, weight it, use it changes over time. On the example of the field of Artificial Intelligence I will illustrate how promising approaches for addressing current problems can be found in the venerable academic literature of the 80s and before, often derogatively called &#8220;Good Old Fashioned AI&#8221;.</p>

<h4>Michael Wojcikiewicz, Morgan Stanley</h4>
<p>Gaining an introspective look at the performance of your computing plant through real-time collection and analysis of metrics can be an invaluable tool. Scaling such a tool for the enterprise to collect data from 100,000+ servers and millions of application instances spread around the globe while being highly available, elastic and extremely fault tolerant can be difficult to say the least. By leveraging several cutting edge Open Source technologies in the nosql/bigdata, distributed systems and monitoring space, the WatchTower project at Morgan Stanley is aiming to achieve exactly that.</p>
