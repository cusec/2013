She loves to read webcomics on the bus to school and play video games when she&#8217;s not coding up a storm for assignments. You can usually find her soaking in the summer outside since her least favourite season is winter and wondering why snow exists. Her goal is to learn more about web programming and how to cook a mean stew in her CrockPot. She&#8217;s also super excited to be part of CUSEC 2013!</p>

Ever since she first attended CUSEC 2 years ago, she has always been impressed by the dedicated group of students that work hard to make it a great success every year! She is ecstatic to be Co-Chair this year and is absolutely proud to be a part of an amazing team!</p>

<div class="organizer"><img class="photo" src="../wp-content/themes/cusec/organizers/bisesar.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Caradec Bisesar</h4>
<p>My name is Caradec Bisesar. I am currently studying Software Engineering at the University Of Toronto: Scarborough Campus. I work at Maxwell Photography as a Technical Specialist, which in other words makes me the &#8216;computer guy&#8217;. I have a strong interest in graphic design, mainly focusing on Photoshop. I also am a very music oriented person; my day isn&#8217;t complete without a little music playing.</p>
</div>
<div class="organizer"><img class="photo" src="../wp-content/themes/cusec/organizers/ricci.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Daniel Ricci</h4>
<p>My name is Daniel Ricci; I am the head delegate for Concordia University and am currently a freshman Computer Science Masters student.  I work at Crescendo Systems as one of their software developers, working in ASP.NET MVC and am heavily involved in JQuery development (but Iâ€™m a true C++ programmer at heart).  I am extremely passionate about Computer Science, and I am always on my computer conjuring up new things, and of course playing insane amounts of video games.  CUSEC has so much to offer you, from networking with employers, to getting an inside view on whatâ€™s really going on in our world of technology.  I seriously recommend you attend CUSEC because, well, would you rather stay home and play with Pandas in World of Warcraft, or talk with employees from companyâ€™s such as Apple, Adobe, Amazon, and Microsoft; I think itâ€™s a no brainer, CUSEC ftw.</p>
</div>
<div class="organizer"><img class="photo" src="../wp-content/themes/cusec/organizers/fudger.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Danielle Fudger</h4>
<p>Danielle is a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph. She is interested in human computer interaction, user experience, as well as mobile application development. In her little free time, Danielle can be found rock-climbing or swimming, and she can never pass up a good book with a comfy chair.</p>
</div>
<div class="organizer"><img class="photo" src="../wp-content/themes/cusec/organizers/badge.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Kruti Bagde</h4>
<p>Kruti Bagde is the Head Delegate of Carleton University and President of the Systems and Computer Engineering Society (SCESoc) at Carleton as well the Systems and Computer Engineering Representative (SCERep) for both Carleton Student Engineering Society (CSES) and Carleton Student Academic Government (CASG). She is a second year student at Carleton University Ottawa, in Computer Systems Engineering.</p>
<p>Her interest in computers developed since she was a toddler. What fascinates her about technology is the fact that it can be re-engineered and improved in so many different ways and that the fact that it is one of the most creative method of development. Robotics is her main interest and reason for choosing Computer Systems Engineering. Kruti is also trained Indian classical dancer, loves to read books; and play Basketball, badminton, and Guitar; watch movies and TV shows. Collecting rare coins is also her hobby.</p>
</div>
<div class="organizer"><img class="photo" src="../wp-content/themes/cusec/organizers/gil.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Santiago Gil</h4>
<p>My name is Santiago Gil and I am a third year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I attended CUSEC back in my first year and it was an awesome three days so anyone interested should definitely come. I&#8217;ve mainly worked on mobile software development, mostly during co-op. When I&#8217;m not in the lab at school or working, you will find me catching up on endless hours of TV, playing video games, or even cooking up something for my neglected food blog.</p>
